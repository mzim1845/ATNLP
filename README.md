# ATNLP Assignment 2

## Project Description

In this project, we will collaboratively reproduce the experiments and results from ["Generalization without Systematicity: On the Compositional Skills of Sequence-to-Sequence Recurrent Networks"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00350) by Brendan Lake and Marco Baroni, focusing on implementing Transformer models instead of traditional RNN architectures for Experiments 1, 2, and 3. Please run the corresponding notebook to execute each of the three experiments.

## Data Description
The SCAN data used in the experiments can be found in the folder called 'data', which was cloned from [https://github.com/brendenlake/SCAN](https://github.com/brendenlake/SCAN), as referenced in the paper.
